            HTML Tags: - Tags are instructions that are embedded directly into the text of the document. An HTML tags begin with less than symbol and end with the greater than symbol.  HTML tags can be two types, paired tags and singular tags. A tag is said to be a paired tag if it has along with a companion end tag. The effects of the paired tag are applied only to the text they contain. For example the <BODY> tag is paired tag. A singular tag does not have a companion end tag. These types of tags are also called as standard-alone tags. For example <BR/> tag is singular tag.  HTML codes which are enclosed between less than and greater than are not case sensitive. The first word or character that appears inside the “<” is called the element. An element is a command that tells the browser to do something, such as <FONT>. Word that follows the element and are contained inside the > of the opening tag are called Properties. Properties are not repeated and are separated by a space, each attribute is assigned a value by an equal sign. The value of the attribute is contained in quotes.
